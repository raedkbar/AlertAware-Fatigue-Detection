# Fatigue Detection System

The Fatigue Detection System is a computer vision project designed to detect signs of employee fatigue through eye monitoring. This system captures images from a camera, processes them to detect eyes, and classifies them as open or closed, enabling the identification of fatigue.

## Features

- Continuous photo capture from a camera.
- Eye detection and cropping in captured images.
- Training and evaluation of a deep learning model for eye classification.
- Alerting when signs of fatigue are detected in real-time.
- Extensible for different use cases and alerting mechanisms.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install using `pip` or `conda`):
  - NumPy
  - pandas
  - TensorFlow
  - OpenCV (cv2)
  - dlib
  - scikit-learn (for dataset manipulation)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fatigue-detection.git
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the shape predictor model file (e.g., `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat`) for dlib's facial landmark detection and place it in the project directory.

4. Update the configuration and set the appropriate URL for alert notifications in the code.

## Usage

1. To capture photos and process them for fatigue detection, run:

   ```bash
   python camera.py
   ```

   This script continuously captures photos from the camera and processes them.

2. To train and evaluate the fatigue detection model, run:

   ```bash
   python fatigue_detection.py
   ```

   This script prepares the dataset, trains a deep learning model, and evaluates its performance.

3. Run the main controller to enable real-time fatigue detection:

   ```bash
   python controller.py
   ```

   The controller captures photos, processes them, and triggers alerts when signs of fatigue are detected.
